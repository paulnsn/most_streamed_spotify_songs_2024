**Authors: Mani Atwal & Paul Ng**

In this project, we explored the Kaggle dataset: Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024 Dataset on Kaggle

We were interested to explore and discover any insights that could help Spotify stakeholders grow their platform.

______

**Platform Distribution Patterns** <br>
Spotify Streams, TikTok Views, and YouTube Views show a strong right-skew, meaning a small subset of songs dominate total attention. Spotify Popularity scores exhibit a more balanced distribution, suggesting curated or algorithmic moderation.

**Cross-Platform Correlations Highlight YouTube’s Role** <br>
There is a moderate positive correlation between YouTube Views and Spotify Streams (≈0.47), indicating that YouTube virality tends to support Spotify streaming success. Conversely, TikTok Views show little to no positive correlation with Spotify streams or popularity, signaling that TikTok virality does not directly translate into Spotify engagement.

**Strong Playlist Influence on Spotify Streams** <br>
There is a strong positive correlation between Spotify Playlist Count and Spotify Streams (correlation = 0.82), suggesting playlists are a major driver of streaming success on Spotify.

**Missed Opportunities from YouTube Hits** <br>
Several tracks have very high YouTube view counts but relatively low Spotify streams. These represent potential missed opportunities where Spotify could increase engagement through enhanced playlisting, targeted promotions, or cross-platform marketing strategies.

**Track Title Analysis** <br>
Certain words in song titles such as "know," "one," "young," "go," "bad," "dont," and "love" are linked to significantly higher average streams, often exceeding 200 million. In contrast, more generic or language-specific words like "music," "back," "song," "version," as well as "de," "el," "la," and terms like "baby," "girl," and "lil" tend to correlate with lower streaming numbers by up to 200 million. While commonly used positive words like "love" provide moderate boosts, some less frequent words such as "know" have much stronger positive effects. This pattern suggests that the choice of words in titles, influenced by language and audience context, plays a key role in streaming success.

**Strategy/Business Recommendations** <br>
1) Advertise/boost songs with high YouTube traction but low Spotify streams to boost cross-platform success.
2) Create curated playlists to boost tracks on Spotify. 
3) TikTok virality isn’t as much of an indicator of success as you may think.
4) Spotify can boost streams by promoting songs with high-impact title words and tailoring marketing by language and audience.
5) Based on a cumulative percentage of streams for the 4,000+ tracks in the dataset, it is found that a significant portion of Spotify streams can be accounted for by a relatively smaller portion of tracks/artists. Alongside other metrics (i.e. YouTube views), Spotify may be able to better identify artists that would perform well (high # of Spotify streams) and sign exclusive deals with them.
